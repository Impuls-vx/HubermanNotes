Fear
	Fear implies stress. But there can be stress without fear.
	Heights - almost everyone responds with fear - visual processing stuff is too deeply linked, no time to consciously process. hands sweat, stomach floating
	Forward movement scares sharks off due to some neurons in retina detecting looming
	Responses: Pause / freeze, Reterat / back up / Go forward
		But what's interesting: LOW Stress -> Pause/Freeze, and HIGH Stress -> Advance
			AND Forward movement in the face of threat is WIRED to Dophamine circuits for reward
				Meaning it's rewarded as a positive experience
				so the key is that you have to confront ...

	And we have to remember that Stress and Fear and Threat are designed to agitate us so that we actually MOVE

	Curve: low level of stress -> low perfromance, and as it increases it goes higher, and it drops off as you get really stressed
		But there's another bump further out, where you perform very well under very high levels of stress
		There's the hightened state of cognition there, changes in time perception(that allow you to evalueate enviroment at a faster framerate essentially)

	

Optimal performance
	There's a sweet spot, if you will, where the level of internal Stress is ideally matched to speed of whatever challange you're facing in outside world
	And when interoception and outeroception are mathced, performance tends to increase

	Also pupil dialation esentially changes your optics, and the change in optics is the change in how you bend time and slice time, and that changes FPS

	With guital learning you wanna be almost sleepy, drousy state to be able to sense some nuance in the chords, or to be relaxed enough so your fingers can follow an external cue. So matching movement of your fingers to what's pure exteroception
