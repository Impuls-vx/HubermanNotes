Huberman #10 - WTF is Stress

Stress is generic

Short stress is cool, long stress(chronic) sucks

BTW, constantly elevated Cortisol is associated with Stress 

Stress response:
	Acetylcholine in body is released - used to move muscles
	AND adrenaline is released in response to Acetylcholine
		Blood vessels dialate, Heart speeds up
	
	So: Stress response makes you wanna MOVE(do something)

Mitigating Stress response: Phisiological sigh
	Hardwired.
	Inhale -> More space, faster heart, speed UP (inhales longer or more vigorous)
	Exhale -> Less space, slower heart, speed DOWN (exhales longer or more vigorous)

	Phisiological Sigh: Double inhale, exhale

Artificial adrenaline:
	25 deep fast inhales/exhales
	then Exhale, hold breath for 15 seconds, repeat
		!!!(does some immune system stuff): Apparently adrenaline defeated diarrhea in that clinical study

!!!Increasing FOV relaxes mind while body's at full output
(raising Stress Threshold)

Tachykinin - molecule of punishment, released in case of social isolation(WTF)
	chronic Tachykinin reeeally sucks - instant transformation into a vegetable

Supplements against chronic stress with a slight possibility of transforming you into a vegetable:
	Ashwaganda: lowers cortisol, lowers total cholesterol by ~10%
	L-theanine: generally a sleep thing, but also effects on anxiety
	Melatonin: Don't.. Just don't
