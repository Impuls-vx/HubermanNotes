Huberman #11 - Mood and gut and food and stuff

Emotions - Aversion and Attractions: either FORWARD or AWAY

Vagus nerve - just a wire from internals to brain(to lizard brain, hence no direct control)
 No direct conscious control, but can be controlled indirectly`
 
 There's neurals in stomach that detect SUGAR and brain makes DOPHAMINE, causing craving MORE

Dopamine: Suprise, excitement. If prediction fails - no dophamine. see Reward prediction error
 L-Tyrasine - Dophamine supplement, amino acid, but don't take chronically
 Macune Prurince - dopamine rich plant or something
 Dophamine promotes SPERM quality
 Testosterone up, subjective well-being UP, Prolactin DOWN

Seratonin: happy to what you have, stupid people are swimming in Seratonin since it's about getting too comfortable
 simply put: Rest and digest

 Carbs increase Seratonin
 
 5-HTP blunts appetite(!!) -- DECREASE in Seratonin BLUNTS apetite

Omega 3 to Omega 6 ratio pupms up mood, "profound effect on depression"
 Study: Omega 3 fed mice didn't want to really drown that much

BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY STILL REQUIRES BETTER LIVING

L-Carnitine:
 Found in meet
 Goes through BloodBrainBarrier as well as BloodNutBarrier
 Blood glusoce lowered, slighly lowered Cholesterol
 Better mood + Decreases symtoms in autism
 Better pregnancy rates, so SPERM pumped UP too

Gut microbiome - Fight for supremacy and dominance between our tiny little pets insise our guts
 Small fragmented foods PROMOTES MOOD (WTF)
 
 Do NOT TAKE Sacharin, other sweeters mostly fine tho

 PROCESSED FOODS are bad - messes with microbiome

 Supplements: Probiotics(but don't overeat 'em)

 FASTING depledes some of our microbiome
  BUT when it's replenished, it's replenished more than before
  SO: make the transition from a fast slowly(few days) and gradually


DECEPTION and Grylin, Top-down controlled:
 Study: those who believed that Milkshake was rich in calories felt less hungry
 
 Study: housekeepers that were told that their work made them healthier ACTUALLY got healhier and had better mood
  WTF
